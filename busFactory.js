// the factory  function should be able to set points and location and calculate the following :
//1. number of trips
//2.single price per trip
//3. number of return trips
//4. price per trip
//need variable for total points
//there should be function that will calculate how much each loaction will cost using conditional statements
//Khayelitsha = R40 , Dunoon = R25 , Mitchells Plain = R30
//another function should calculate how much increase to add if it is peak time (if the user selects a location in the previous function it should add certain percnetage to that amount)
//to calculate the amount increased divide the normal price by 100 multiply that by 25% and then add that to the original amount
//to each of these functions need to another functon that will only return the counters
